Concept of a script for doing pdf split by page number chunks, to be ingested by AWS Textract, GCP cloud vision or Azure data factory.
Those services have a max page hard limit, so I will be testing chunks.

Requires: pdftk, pdftk-java

TBA


-------------------------------------
Usage:
chmod +x split_pdf_by_chunk.sh

Run:
./split_pdf_by_chunk.sh path/to/file
