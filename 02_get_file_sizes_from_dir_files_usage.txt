A bash script that from a directory lists each filename.extension and the size of it in human readable format.


----------------------------------------
Usage:
To use the script, go to where is stored, and make it executable using the command

chmod +x get_file_sizes_from_dir_files.sh


Then, run the script with the name of the files directory path as an argument:
SYNTAX: ./get_file_sizes_from_dir_files.sh ARGUMENT

./get_file_sizes_from_dir_files.sh /PATH/TO/DIR

Replace PATH/TO/DIR with the name of the actual directory.

Example:
$ ./get_file_sizes_from_dir_files /PATH/TO/DIR > output.txt
----------------------------------------


Explanation
1. The script checks if an argument is provided. If not, it prints a usage message and exits.

2. The script checks if the directory provided as an argument exists. If not, it prints an error message and exits.

3. The script uses a for loop to iterate over all files in the directory provided as an argument.

4. For each file, the script uses the du command to get the size of the file in bytes. 
The -h option makes the output human-readable. 
The awk command is used to print only the first column of the output, which contains the size in megabytes.

5. The script uses the basename command to get the filename without the directory path.

6. The script prints the filename and size in megabytes.
