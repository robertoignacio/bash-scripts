Having an index.html containing urls pointing to pdf files,
here is a sed command to retrieve those urls and write them to an output text file:

sed -n 's/.*href="\([^"]*\.pdf\)".*/\1/p' index.html > urls_file.txt



The URLs in the index.html file are enclosed in anchor tags (<a> tags) 
with the href attribute pointing to the PDF files, to retrieve the URLs:

sed -n 's/.*href="\([^"]*\.pdf\)".*/\1/p' index.html


Explanation:
Here's how the command works:

    • The -n option suppresses normal output so that only the matched URLs are printed.
    • The s command searches for lines that match the regular expression 
        .*href="\([^"]*\.pdf\)".* 
    and replaces them with the contents of the first capture group (\1).
    • The regular expression matches any line containing href followed by a URL enclosed in quotes and ending in .pdf.
    • The \( and \) are used to capture the matched URL so that it can be referenced later with \1.
    • The p at the end of the command tells sed to print the matched URL.

    Note: This ses command considers that the URLs are enclosed in double quotes. 
    If the URLs are enclosed in single quotes, the sed command will need to be modified.
