Given a directory called pdf_files that contains several pdf files. 
A bash script to convert the pdf files to text files, and a new directory to store these text files. 
Includes a counting message for process completion. 


-----------------------------------------------
Usage:
To use the script, save it locally, and make it executable using the command:

chmod +x convert_pdfs_to_text.sh

Then, run the script with the directory path as an argument:
SYNTAX: ./convert_pdfs_to_text.sh ARGUMENT-PATH

./convert_pdfs_to_text.sh /path/to/pdf_files

Replace /path/to/pdf_files with the actual path to the directory containing the PDF files. 
The converted text files will be stored in the text_files directory inside the specified directory.

-----------------------------------------------
Explanation:
1. The script sets a counter variable to 0 to keep track of the number of PDF files that have been converted.

2. The script uses the find command to get the total number of PDF files in the directory provided as an argument. 
The wc command is used to count the number of lines in the output.

3. The script uses a for loop to iterate over all PDF files in the directory provided as an argument. 
The basename command is used to get the filename without the .pdf extension.

4. For each PDF file, pdftotext is used to convert the file to a text file 
with the same name as the original PDF file but with the .txt extension. 
The -layout option preserves the layout of the original PDF file.

5. The counter variable is incremented after each PDF file is converted.

6. The percentage completed is calculated by dividing the counter variable by the total number of PDF files and multiplying by 100.

7. The script prints a message indicating the percentage completed and the name of the PDF file that has been converted.

8. Finally, the script prints a message indicating that the PDF files have been converted to text files and stored in the text_files directory.
The percentage completed will be updated for each PDF file that is converted.
