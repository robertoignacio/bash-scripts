From a directory containing files,
a bash script that copies all files that match a condition into a new directory. 
The condition in this script is: being less than 5 MB in size.


----------------------
Usage:
Make the script executable:
chmod +x copy_files.sh

Run the script with two arguments:
./copy_files.sh /path/to/source/directory /path/to/destination/directory

-----------------------
Explanation of the script:
1. Checks if the script is called with exactly two arguments. 
If not, it prints an error message and exits.
"Usage: $0 <path to source dir> <path to destination dir>"

2. Assign the first argument <path to source dir> to a src_dir variable.

3. Assign the second argument <path to destination dir> to the dest_dir variable.

4. Create the destination directory if it doesn't already exist. 
The -p option tells mkdir to create parent directories as needed.
mkdir -p "$dest_dir"

5. Find all files in the source directory that are less than 5 MB in size (-size -5M) 
and copies them to the destination directory (-exec cp {} "$dest_dir" \;). 
The -maxdepth 1 option tells find to only search for files in the source directory, not in subdirectories.
find "$src_dir" -maxdepth 1 -type f -size -5M -exec cp {} "$dest_dir" \;
